Some time ago I found a video on YouTube that looked pretty interesting, and I decided to watch just a bit of it to see whether I liked it.
One hour after, I had watched the **whole** thing and was **fascinated** by what I just saw.
That video was called "CS Unplugged".

This video is part of a [project][1] created by the University if Canterbury (New Zealand) and also sponsored by Carnegie Mellon and Google,
and that had as its (initial) goal to show children (around 10-13 years old) **what Computer Science is REALLY all about**.
They have developed a nice series of [activities][2]
that instigate the curiosity of the children and make them understand the fundamental concepts of, among others:
binary codes, compression, sorting, searching, human-computer interaction, information theory and public-key criptography.

I was VERY enthusiastic about the whole idea, and also a bit jealous of those kids:
they had a deeper and **more inspiring** class on Computer Science than several CS bachelor students get from their lecturers!
This video also inspired me and reminded me once more of an old dream: teach Computer Science to school children.
So, there you have it, the AWESOME "CS Unplugged" video:
