Today is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Alan Mathison Turing, the FATHER of Computer Science.

Dear Alan, I am deeply thankful for your work, your insights and your dedication to our science and the freedom in our world.
You are, and will always be, an inspiration for me, in whichever computing-related research acitivities I might be engaged in :)

R.I.P Alan Turing.

Some time ago (I think 1 or 2 years)  - [here is the post](/en/blog/misc/nerd-songs) - I found
a very nice and professional song on YouTube, by a group called "Klein 3".
The song is called "No deciding".
Here it goes, in tribute to our forefather:
