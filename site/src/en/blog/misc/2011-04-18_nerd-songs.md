Sunday-night post :), the sort of things that "forever alone" people do...

On [Gi's blog][1] (a very good one, BTW) I just found a link to a song that is a huge Computer Science in-joke: "No deciding", from Klein3.
Those of you who studied Theory of Computation will get the song,
those of you who didn't can still ignore the lyrics and enjoy the soothing melody :]

The second song for tonight comes from "Klein4", this time a group of mathematicians/musicians.
As you can guess, it's a song about groups.
And AGAIN, even if you don't have the slightest idea of what a group might be, the guys are damn good.
Of course, understanding the lyrics is so much fun...
