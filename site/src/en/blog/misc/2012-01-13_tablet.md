title: My new computer: A chinese tablet

Yeah - I just bought a chinese tablet (a.k.a _"chinapad"_) running Android.
Specifically, it is sold by DealExtreme,
has a 7-inch screen and runs Android 2.3.5 (Gingerbread) - with an Android 4.0 ROM already being developed by the manufacturer.
And WHY did I buy it?
Recently I have been a bit frustrated with my good old Atom netbook, since it has lost its battery life _completely_ and accumulates several small glitches.
It has become - put simply - an expensive desktop from the beginning of the past decade :P

So, thinking about what to buy in order to mitigate this frustration, I seriously considered a tablet.
Of course tablets are "trendy" nowadays - I know - but I sincerely think that a tablet can fulfill most of my "use cases" for a computer,
besides being very cheap and much more portable.

I wanted a tablet that allowed me to do ALMOST everything I do with a PC, except for the most creative/productive tasks.
These "productive" use cases are, mostly:

  1. Programming (C++/Python/Haskell :D)
  2. Writing stuff in LaTeX (papers, presentations, letters, etc.)
  3. Posting on this blog

These specific tasks would still be accomplished with the help of my old netbook/desktop.
The rest is taken care of by the _chinapad_:

  * Listening to music / Watching movies, TV shows and YouTube
  * Reading
  * Browsing the interwebs
  * Social networks and chat stuff
  * Playing some 2D games and some light 3D games
  * Some useful tasks as checking maps, controlling my finances, calendar, scanning documents, etc.

With a usage scenario such as this in mind, I decided I needed a powerful tablet - but NOT SO MUCH.
It needed to be better than my current netbook (almost NOTHING can be worse), but not necessarily running at the speed of light...
So I did a lot of research in bizarre east-asian forums and blogs until I decided I would buy THIS ONE:

 ![Rena3 / Haipad M9](/files/imgs/2012-01_sku_81345_7.jpg)

</div>

I chose the Rena3 for two fundamental reasons:

  1. Very cost-efficient (sells for US$165,99 on [DX][1])

  2. Has an active developer community and is easy to customize

Here are Rena3's detailed specs:

  * **PRICE:** US$165,99 on [DX][2]
  * **Screen:** 5-point capacitive multi-touch, 7 inches with 800x480 resolution
  * **CPU:** Renesas EV2 - Dual core ARM Cortex A9 @ 1GHz each
  * **GPU:** PowerVX SGX530
  * **RAM:** 512MB DDR2
  * **Internal storage:** 4GB NAND Flash
  * **Storage expansion:** microSD(HC) slot, up to 32GB @ 10MB/s
  * 3200mAh battery, lasting for aprox. 8h of "moderate" usage
  * Wi-fi 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 2.1
  * Front-facing 2MP camera
  * **Slots and ports:**
      + mini-HDMI out
      + 1 mini-USB 2.0 Host (to use with pendrives, 3g modems, keyboards, etc.)
      + 1 mini-ISB 2.0 OTG (to connect the tablet to a PC)
      + microSD(HC) slot
      + 3.5mm headphone jack

I will plugin in a fast 32GB microSD card, so that I can leave a lot of media files in the tablet itself (my entire music collection and a lot of videos).
I plan to listen to music and podcasts with it, as well as watch movies and TV shows using a good stereo bluetooth headset.
Also, this tablet will be my e-book reader. HDMI-out is a plus,
and will be mostly useful to watch some videos with my family and perhaps even play some SNES games on the living room TV \o/

There is, in fact, already a vibrant developer community around this tablet,
and several good custom ROMs are available for download on its [Slatedroid.com page][3].

As well as a lot of research over the tablet itself,
I also spent a considerable amount of time searching for the best applications to suit each of my use cases for the device.
After some 2 weeks all over the Android market, reddit and specialized blogs, I came up with this list:

Now I just have to wait (a lot) until my new toy reaches Brazil, with a leather case and a 32GB microSD.
Wait and pray, so that nothing wrong happens during shipping...
As soon as I get my hands onto it, I will post a review here with some photos and videos :)
