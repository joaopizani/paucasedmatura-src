And here I am, again, trying to keep a place in the Internet to write whatever comes to my mind.
And indeed several things come to my mind :)
Technology, Computer Science, Music (classical or not), Philosophy, and of course, **day-to-day ramblings.**

I now have a computer that can be carried along throughout the house and used on the couch.
Perhaps this can help me fill this place with posts :)

If you are wondering who the hell I am, in the page with the very self-explanatory title "Who am I" you'll find something...
