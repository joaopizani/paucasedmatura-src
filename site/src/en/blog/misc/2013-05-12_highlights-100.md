More than 4 years ago, on February 2009, I "founded" this blog, when I was still a young CS bachelor student,
having recently joined the Federal University of Santa Catarina (Brazil) :P

In these last 4 years, A LOT of things happened, and 99 (this is the hundredth) posts were written and published here.
I still wish to keep writing on this blog for years to come, and to celebrate the mark of 100 posts, I compiled a list of "the best" posts until now.
Actually, the list consists of posts that I find the most personally memorable, or "famous" (by number of readers).
There they go (in ascending chronological order):
