It took me long to start this tutorial, but I had a noble excuse: I was finishing my B.Sc thesis (in Computer Science)...
Nevermind that, let's start the VHDL coding!
In the first episode of our tutorial we deal with a binary adder.

In case you don't know what a binary adder is, the world's no. 1 source of information (Wikipedia) is always there to help you:
[Binary Adder][1]. Our first hardware described using VHDL is going to be a 1-bit _Full Adder_:

And to show that VHDL isn't such an ugly monster, here's the adder's code, complete:

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity fullAdder is
    Port(
        a    : in std_logic;
        b    : in std_logic;
        cin  : in std_logic;
        s    : out std_logic;
        cout : out std_logic);
end fullAdder;

architecture arch of fullAdder is
    signal aXorB : std_logic;
begin
    aXorB <= a xor b;
    s     <= aXorB xor cin;
    cout  <= (a and b) or (cin and aXorB);
end arch;
```

So let's first talk a bit about the code just above and then write and run some tests to show that this amazing adder works!

During the following episodes I'm going to show you the VHDL coding style I adopt.
The first tidbit of this style is that each hardware block resides in a similarly named text file.
Our fullAdder will then reside in `fullAdder.vhd`.

Each VHDL file has TWO main sections: `entity` and `architecture`.
The entity section describes the block's interface to the outside world, e that `Port(..` construct means _exactly_ what you think it means:
it's a list of the block's input and output ports.
Each port has a _name_, a _direction_ and a _type_.
By the way, EVERYTHING in VHDL has a type, some people love it, some hate it, nobody remains indifferent :)

The datatype we are using in all of our adder's ports is `std_logic`,
a binary type which besides '0' and '1' has some other possible values (high impedance, undefined and others I completely forgot).
The `std_logic` type and its `std_logic_vector` partner are by far the most popular VHDL types.

Now a bit about the second section of all VHDL files: the _architecture_.
In this section we define all the building blocks for our circuit, how to interconnect them and which signals to use for these connections.
Just before the `begin` keyword we need to _declare_ everything that's going to be used in the architecture;
in our case we declare only one signal:

```vhdl
signal aXorB : std_logic;
```

Signals can be thought of as wires, or buses. They also have a name and type, but no direction.
After all declarations we start the _body_ of the architecture itself.
In our architecture for a full adder we do three _parallel assignments_.
Each of them binds a signal (or port) to an expression.
Because the assignment is parallel, the signal (or port) is bound to the expression forever,
and if you try to bind a signal more than once the VHDL compiler will refuse to work - it's as if you were doing a short-circuit :)
The parallel assignments in our architecture are just a copy of the logical expressions defining a full adder (according to Wikipedia)

```vhdl
S = A xor B xor Cin
Cout = (A and B) or (Cin and (A xor B))
```

The coding style that we can infer from this first episode follows:

  * In general:
      + All code blocks between "begin" and "end" (or "is" and "end") are indented, always using 4 spaces.
      + Port names and signal names are written in `camelCaseWithFirstLower`.

  * In the `entity` section:
      + The "Port" keyword is indented in relation to the "entity", and the port list itself is indented in relation to the `Port(..`.
      + All semicolons in the port list are aligned vertically.

  * In the `architecture` section:
      + In a sequence of assignments, we align all arrows (<=) vertically.

This is a VHDL coding style which I personally find beautiful and readable.
So please don't start the flame war :)

After the style talk we start the final part of this episode: to show that our design works (test it) \o/
First of all, let's run GHDL just to confirm that our code's syntax is OK:

    ghdl -s fullAdder.vhd

Now for the really fun part: we'll write a _testbench_ for our adder.
From now on, for every hardware block that we write, we'll have a corresponding testbench.
A testbench is just a VHDL file providing some inputs to the design under test and checking that the outputs are as expected.
The testbench for our fullAdder is here: <http://hpaste.org/47881>

The testbench's code is big for this case, and surely there are ways to make it smaller and prettier.
Anyways, I chose to write it this way to show the _general guidelines_ that all next episodes will follow.

The `entity` section in a testbench is always empty, and in the `architecture` section there's a certain pattern:

  * Declarations:
      + First we declare the `component` being tested, we simply copied the port list from the `fullAdder.vhd` file.
      + Then we have one signal declared for each port of the component being tested.
      + The `for dut: fullAdder...` is a sort of GHDL specificity and we can ignore it for now...

  * Test cases:
      + Just after the `begin` keyword we _instantiate the component under test_.
        It means we bind its ports to the signals we just declared.
        These are the signals we are going to monitor on the testbench.

      + Inside the testbench `process` there are several _test cases_, each with expected and actual outputs

As in our design (fullAdder) there are only 8 possible input combinations (3 bits), we tested all of them.
This is usually not the case,
and hardware designers test only the combinations which they consider most "significant" to demonstrate the block's functionality.
Each test case has approximately the same format:

```vhdl
sig_<0> <= value_<0>;
...
sig_<1> <= value_<1>;
wait for x ns;
assert (expected_output = actual_output) report "test_name" severity failure;
```

We give a value for each of the circuit's inputs,
then wait for some time (so that the outputs are stable) and check whether the actual output is the one we expected...

Well people, that's all for today.
The first episode of the tutorial was pretty lengthy because a lot of concepts had to be introduced "from scratch".
Here we go with some exercises!

**Exercises for today's episode:**

  1. Download the file [VHDL1][2], unzip it, run the simulation and view the generated trace.vcd in GTKWave.
     The included _makefile_ shall help you

  2. Modify some tests, make them fail and then correct them...
     Hack the code at will :) The same structure of files and the same style will be used in all following episodes...
