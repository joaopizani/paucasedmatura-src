Today was a long day, but one of the most exciting, and certainly one of the most important of my life until now.

For those who did not yet know, I applied for a Ph.D position at
[Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se/en/Pages/default.aspx),
in Gothenburg (Sweden), with Prof. Mary Sheeran as supervisor.

So, some weeks ago I received an invitation to come to Sweden and take part in a day-long final selection process,
as I was one of the "final" 5 candidates pre-selected for the position.
As part of the process, we had to each give a talk about a research topic with which we were involved,
and later in the afternoon go through a detailed and thorough interview.

It was a long day, as I already mentioned... From 9:00 until 12:00 talks, then from 13:00 until 16:00 interviews.
Then the most nerve-racking moment of all: we waited for 1 hour while the selection committee came to a decision.
At about 17:00, on Wednesday, June 4th 2014, the decision came: I was chosen!!!
I got an offer for a doing a Ph.D at the Functional Programming group of Chalmers. What a moment!

Now I guess I just to get some much needed sleep, and only then figure out what the next steps will be... :)
