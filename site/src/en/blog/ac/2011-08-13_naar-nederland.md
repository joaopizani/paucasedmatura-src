Since my last post (Last post on Brazil) until this one (First post in the Netherlands) something very important happened:
I arrived in the Netherlands \\o/\\o/ More specifically,
I travelled from Florianopolis to São Paulo, and from there to Amsterdam, the capital (or not) of Holland.

This post is almost entirely made of photos, I'm actually getting some talent for telling a story using pictures :)
The travel that brought me here was actually the longest journey of my life performed _ENTIRELY with public transportation_.
I took the bus to Florianópolis' airport, took a train from Schiphol to Amsterdam Zuid, and a tram to the hostel...
Well, after the first bus to Florianópolis' airport, I boarded flight GOL7651 to São Paulo,
that took off under the sun that was only starting to shine:

That's all for now, folks...
I just arrived!  Soon I'll be uploading several pictures with all my adventures in the capital of the Netherlands.
I've been away for some time, without acces to any computer nor the Internet, so that explains the delay...
