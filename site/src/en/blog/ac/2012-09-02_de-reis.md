THE TIME HAS COME, finally.
In less than an hour I am going to the airport,
say goodbye to family and friends and begin the long journey - full of connections - that in around 24 hours will bring me to my HOME:
the city of Utrecht, in the Kingdom of The Netherlands.

I am VERY excited with the whole experience, as you all probably already know, and can't wait to board that plane.
On the other hand, however, I am going to miss my family and old friends a lot,
I am going to miss everything that we experienced together in Brazil, specially in those last days here.

I will ALWAYS remember fondly all my experiences on this land.
I don't WANT to forget my roots.
Even if I WANTED, though, I could not...
I am what I am because of you, I do what I do and think what I think because of all we lived together and all the ideas we exchanged...

See you in the next posts, already on dutch land! Au revoir! At√© mais! Tot ziens!

PS: This is the result of emptying my room :P
