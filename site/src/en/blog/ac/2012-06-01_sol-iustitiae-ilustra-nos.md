This time I have quite revolutionary news - at least for me. Perhaps some (really VERY few) of you already knew it,
some others won't be surprised, and the rest would have never imagined it...

Lacking a better, more subtle way to say it, I'll be direct and bold (using bold text, I mean :P):

**On September 2012 I will leave Brazil,
to start a M.Sc degree programme in Computer Science at [Utrecht University][1] in the Netherlands**.
Utrecht is the most prestigious and best ranked university in the Netherlands, and one the most prestigious of Europe.
Oh, and of course, **I'm UNBELIEVABLY happy and enthusiastic about the whole opportunity!**

There are still A LOT of details and practicalities to be defined, but here is a small "FAQ" about the trip:

  * My outbound flight departs from Brazil on **September 2nd, 2012**.
    I **haven't really thought about returning**. I will be living in the Netherlands for AT LEAST two years...

  * I was awarded a full scholarship by the Utrecht University Fund, the [UES][2].

  * I'm going to study (in a hardcore way, so to speak) Haskell,
    and will be part of the programme "Computing Science - Software Technology".

  * I'm making one of the biggest **(if not THE biggest)** dream of my life come true.

  * YEAH, I want to celebrate this unique occasion with all of my friends, and PARTY HARD before my departure :D

So, from now on,
stay tuned for updates about the preparations and - perhaps - some of the first posts in this blog "in het Nederlands" :)
