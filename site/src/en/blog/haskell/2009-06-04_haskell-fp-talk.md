Today I presented a seminar about "Functional programming and the Haskell programming language".
This presentation is part of the [Seminários Individuais][1] project at [PET Computação - UFSC][2].

I've talked about what is functional programming and what are its greatest features.
I've also shown the unique characteristics of Haskell that make it not just another programming language.
The current state of the Haskell development toolchain and libraries was shown,
and I also gave some directions about downloads, books and good tutorials for those interested in learning Haskell.

It's always nice talking about something you like :)
I already posted here in the blog another [article][4] with some reasons to learn Haskell.
The slides from the presentation are available here:
