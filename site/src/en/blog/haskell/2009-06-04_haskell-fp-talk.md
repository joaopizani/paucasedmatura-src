Today I presented a seminar about "Functional programming and the Haskell programming language".
This presentation is part of the [Seminários Individuais][1] project at [PET Computação - UFSC][2].

I have talked about what functional programming is and what are its greatest features.
I have also shown the unique characteristics of Haskell that make it NOT just another programming language.
The current state of the Haskell development toolchain and libraries was shown,
and I also gave some directions about downloads, books and good tutorials for those interested in learning Haskell.

It's always nice talking about something you like :)
I already posted here in the blog another [article][4] with some reasons to learn Haskell.
The slides from the presentation are available here: [Seminar - Prog. Funcional e Haskell (in portuguese)][3]
