title: Learning and installing Haskell is easier than ever!

It's been a long time since my last post about functional programming and the [Haskell][1] programming language...
I've written a [post](/en/blog/haskell/haskell-start) last year showing
all the reasons I think are enough to convince you that you should learn Haskell.
From then on much changed and I have great news to tell.
The language is evolving in all aspects, and I'm lucky to witness this evolution \o/\o/

The Haskell compiler ([GHC][2] - The Glorious Haskell Compilation system)
generates faster code release after release, the community of people using the language is booming,
including big enterprises like Facebook :D
There are Haskell libraries to accomplish every imaginable and unimaginable task,
and these libraries are centralized and organized in the [Hackage][3] repository.
Are you using a library and need to search its documentation? Use [Hoogle][4], the central Haskell documentation search engine...
BUT, in this huge pool of good news I want to pick two special ones:

[1]: <http://haskell.org>
[2]: <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/>
[3]: <http://hackage.haskell.org>
[4]: <http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/>

1) Learning Haskell is easier than ever.
In my old post I mentioned already the nice tutorial (for beginners)
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!][5] and the book [Real World Haskell][6].
Now, great guys have created an even more awesome tool to learn Haskell:
if you want to follow a good Haskell tutorial, practicing as you read,
and even though install NOTHING onto your PC, go to the [Try Haskell!][7] website.
It's an interactive Haskell tutorial, you code as you learn, in the comfort of your favorite browser :)

[6]: <http://book.realworldhaskell.org/>
[7]: <http://tryhaskell.org/>

2) If you enjoyed the test-drive and wanna install Haskell in your PC it's also easier than ever.
Now all the essential tools and libraries for a Haskell programmer are bundled in the [Haskell Platform][8].
Everything tested, stable and working nicely together.
You just need to go to the [platform's website][9], choose your operating system, and install.
Surely in Ubuntu the install process is the simplest of all:
you add the repository and then type into a terminal:  `sudo aptitude install haskell-platform` :D

[8]: <http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/>
[9]: <http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/>

And to prove that installation is really EASY,
I've recorded a videocast of me installing the Haskell Platform on Ubuntu and put it on YouTube.
Here it goes:
