This was my last semester of graduation :|
There was a lot of relaxation due to the P.E courses I've taken, but also a lot of stress due to the Final Graduation Project.
Meanwhile, I did exams that gave me FREE English credits;
I  also studied Pattern Recognition, just to keep in my mind how hard it is to take a real course :)

Best course of the semester goes to: "Dance and Improvisation", no doubts about it!
