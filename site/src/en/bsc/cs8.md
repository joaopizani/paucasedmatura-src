title: Computer Science - 8th term
pt: pt/bsc/cs8
---

August, September, October, November... until the 10th December 2010 went my 8th semester of Computer Science at the Federal University of Santa Catarina.
It began with the kick-off of my graduation project.
I will research and write my thesis in the field of Reconfigurable Computing, at LISHA/UFSC (under Prof. Antônio Augusto Medeiros Fröhlich, Ph.D).

Besides the thrill of the graduation project, the only "hard" course I took was Artificial Intelligence.
We turned in several practical projects and there was also a vast theoretical content we needed to cover.
Also, in this semester I realized a big dream of mine: I took tennis classes (for free) :). Finally!
