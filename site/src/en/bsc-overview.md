I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) - Brazil.
I joined the program on March 2007, and graduated on July 2011.

From October 2007 to March 2010 I worked with the [PET Computação - UFSC][1] group.
The Tutorial Education Program (PET in Portuguese) is an honours program, in which undergraduate students develop,
under the supervision of a tenured professor, projects involving teaching, research and university extension.

From August 2010 to August 2011 (graduation) I was a member of the [Software/Hardware Integration Laboratory][4],
where I worked with research and development on Reconfigurable Computing, high-level hardware design and SoC (Systems-on-Chip) synthesis.
There I developed my [B.Sc thesis][5] and contributed to industrial research.

During my undergraduate years I had two international experiences:

  * First in 2010, when I was granted a scholarship from [DAAD][6] (the German Academic Exchange Office)
    to take part in an intensive german language and culture course, in Düsseldorf - where I lived for two months.

  * Then in 2011, I spent 20 days in the Netherlands, taking part in the [Utrecht Summer School in Applied Functional Programming][7],
    supported by a scholarship from [Utrecht University][8].

At the end of my B.Sc programme, I pusblished a paper in a IEEE conference:

  * [High-level design and synthesis of a resource scheduler](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2011.6122379)

Here are some important documents from those 4 years of studies:
