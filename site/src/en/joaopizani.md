Surely it's easier to say what I hate than what I like.

I hate jokes taken seriously and serious things dealt with as jokes.
I'm gonna make this tought clear on the posts here.
What can you expect of the things written here? Random thoughts.

If I write something here, it has nothing to do with what I currently am or think.
It has to do with what I THOUGHT and WERE when I wrote what I wrote. You have been warned!
