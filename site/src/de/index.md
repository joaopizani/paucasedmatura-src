Hi! I am Jo√£o Paulo Pizani Flor (_joaopizani_) and this is my personal webpage.
The page's name (_Pauca sed matura_) is a latin phrase literally meaning "_few but ripe_".
Often referred to as the personal motto of [Gauss](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss),
this is also something which I think I can relate to...

Currently, I am studying for my master's degree in Computing Science at
[Utrecht University](http://www.uu.nl), in The Netherlands.
I enjoy very much functional programming, Haskell, Agda, fiddling with Linux/Unix,
and also a lot of non-techie stuff. The pages and posts here should give an idea of these passions.
